# Multi-Cloud Deployment with Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform

This repository contains code and configuration files for deploying a containerized application (frontend and backend) across AWS, Azure, and GCP. The project leverages Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, Terraform for infrastructure provisioning, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a robust, scalable, and cost-efficient multi-cloud deployment strategy using:

- **Docker:** Containerize the frontend and backend applications.
- **Kubernetes:** Deploy and manage containers across AWS, Azure, and GCP.
- **Terraform:** Provision and manage cloud-specific resources.
- **GitHub Actions:** Automate builds, tests, and deployments.
- **Monitoring:** Use Prometheus and Grafana to monitor application performance.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/)
- [Google Cloud SDK (gcloud)](https://cloud.google.com/sdk)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/)

Also, configure your cloud provider credentials locally:

- **AWS:** `aws configure`
- **Azure:** `az login`
- **GCP:** `gcloud auth login`

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sathvik-ng-07/multi-cloud-app.git
cd multi-cloud-app
```

### 2. Configure Secrets and Environment Variables

- **Container Registry:**  
  Create and configure a Docker registry (e.g., AWS ECR, Azure ACR, or GCP GCR) and set its URL as an environment variable or secret named `REGISTRY`.

- **Cloud Provider Credentials:**  
  Ensure your AWS, Azure, and GCP credentials are properly set up on your local machine.

### 3. Provision Cloud Infrastructure

Run the provided setup script to provision the necessary cloud infrastructure using Terraform:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/setup.sh
./scripts/setup.sh
```

This script will initialize and apply Terraform configurations for AWS, Azure, and GCP, provisioning Kubernetes clusters and any other required resources.

### 4. Build and Deploy the Application

**Build Docker Images:**

From the project root, build the Docker images for the frontend and backend:

```bash
# Build the frontend image
docker build -t ${REGISTRY}/frontend:latest ./frontend

# Build the backend image
docker build -t ${REGISTRY}/backend:latest ./backend
```

**Deploy to Kubernetes:**

Ensure that your Kubernetes contexts for AWS, Azure, and GCP are configured. Then, deploy the application by running:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/deploy.sh
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

This script will:

- Update image references in your Kubernetes manifests.
- Deploy the frontend and backend services across all configured Kubernetes clusters.

## CI/CD Pipeline

A GitHub Actions workflow is set up in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` to automate the build, push, and deployment process when changes are pushed to the `main` branch. Make sure your repository secrets (e.g., `REGISTRY`) are properly configured in GitHub.

## Monitoring

Monitoring is configured using Prometheus and Grafana:

- **Prometheus:** Monitors application metrics.
- **Grafana:** Visualizes the metrics.

To access Grafana, run:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/grafana 3000:3000
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Multi-Cloud Management:**  
  Implement a federated service mesh (Istio) for better cross-cloud communication.
- **Cost Optimization:**  
  Integrate Kubecost for detailed cost monitoring and optimization.
- **Security Enhancements:**  
  Deploy Vault for secrets management and implement stricter network policies.
- **Disaster Recovery:**  
  Use Velero for cross-cloud backup and automated failover.
- **Advanced CI/CD:**  
  Introduce canary deployments, A/B testing, and integrated security scanning.
